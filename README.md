1.	Read Microclimate sensors data (https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/microclimate-sensors-data/export/) and printed the feature name with numbers of missing entries.
2.	Fill in the missing entries. For filling any feature, imputed with mean or median value of the feature values from observed entries.
3.	Used a histogram to show the distribution of the variable “PM25” and “PM10” and showed a correlation between them.
4.	Splited the variable “LatLong" using an appropriate encoding approach and displayed the encoded values.
5.	Applied the min-max scaling on continuous features. Showed plot distribution of these features before and after scaling.
